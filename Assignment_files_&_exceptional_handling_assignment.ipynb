Garbage Collection: Garbage collection is the process of automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer being used by the program.In Python, this is done by the garbage collector, which tracks and frees memory from objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the program. The reference counting mechanism is used, where each object has a reference count that tracks how many references are pointing to it. When this count reaches zero, the object is automatically deleted. Additionally, Python’s garbage collector deals with circular references (where two objects refer to each other) which regular reference counting can’t clean up."
